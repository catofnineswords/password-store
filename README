Simple Password Store
Forked from: Jason Donenfeld, Jason@zx2c4.com

======================

RenÃ©e's modifications:
- Forced copying of passwords to the clipboard, which effectively disables them being displayed on screen
- git version 1.8.3 (RHEL 7.x) does not have the -C option, so all calls to "git -C $INNER_GIT_DIR" fail catastrophically.
  git --git-dir $INNER_GIT_DIR is not a suitable replacement


This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.
